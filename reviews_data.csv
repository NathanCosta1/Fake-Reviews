"absolutely movie of the year for me. unbelievably funny and thoughtful and gorgeous, i wanted to pause on every frame! every character is rendered with such care and depth and without a hint of morality placed on their actions for the audience. would make an incredible double bill withThe Lobsterobviously, but alsoTitane.obvious why everyone’s discussing this from a feminist lens but as someone 2 years out of an autism diagnosis i saw a lot of that…",14 Dec 2023,0,1844,22,157,1844

"I hatedPoor Thingsand reviewed it for Vulture. That people are speaking of this as a rousing, weird, feminist treatise is insane. How are y’all so easily fooled by such glaring misogyny???? Except below.Read my review here at Vulture.“there’s a corroded spirit to the story, like it’s intermittently possessed by an edgelord who’s unaware most women menstruate, and an early-wave white feminist who believes having sex is the most empowering thing a woman can do.

"objecting to a movie essentially everyone adores is a very lonely feeling. and i don’t think i’ve ever been so outnumbered. this movie was not made for me, yes, but that inevitably becomes its very problem. how can a movie that marketed itself as an exploration of womanhood not be for me? maybe it’s because my feminism is not stuck in thoughtless 2010s 3rd wave influenced sexual liberation that deems fucking the most empowering thing a woman can do. maybe…",08 Dec 2023,1,529,49,33,0

"a cinematic feast. there are a handful of small lulls in the second act, but as a complete picture it devours. the absurdity and tragedy of living boiled down to a rich concentrate and then spray painted all over the walls. i’m craving that rewatch alreadygotta be a career best for emma stone, and i don’t say that lightly. her character progression is so intuitive that it’s sometimes almost difficult to watch. human nature captured in facial expressions and…",07 Dec 2023,9,2597,10,301,2597
Don’t know yet what I’m going to rate this because I did enjoy it but idk how you do alllll of what this film does and never once show menstrual blood. It still so very much feels like a man’s idea of women’s sexuality and liberation. Still keeps women as objects despite so desperately wanting to show them as the “master of their own ship.” A real conundrum.NYFF #5,29 Sep 2023,5,11398,204,391,11398

"Acknowledging that this is as hollow and frothy an act of male-gaze feminism as Barbie was a corporate didactic toy commercial (I found both extremely entertaining) does not mean this movie isn’t also a gloriously weird modern cartoon parable about fathers and daughters, little girls and women, husbands and wives, lovers and enemies, sex workers and clients, cruelty and humanity, philosophy and reality, and the balance between the desire for an adventurous life and the joys of a settled one.…",15 Dec 2023,8,3565,22,1894,3565

"It’s interesting knowing a movie will be your favorite of the year long before you ever get to watch it.Poor things is a stunning story about discovery, SO MUCH discovery. Its a movie that can juggle a billion aspects of life. Moving on from one to the next so seamlessly akin to how we do in our everyday lives.There’s so much humanity found in a movie about a sown-together cadaver reanimated.

"I'm genuinely concerned that so many people have found this film to be a praiseworthy feminist fable and not the grotesque, disturbing, and perverse fairy tale that it so clearly is. I can accept some level of pornographic content in films when it comes to sex, but what is effectively mental child pornography I cannot. This film proposes that the activating key to self-discovery and growth for a woman comes in sexual freedom and promiscuity. But she's not a woman.…",19 Dec 2023,1,4448,38,564,4448

"stunning production + costume design, gorgeous colors, and perfect score. i think anyone looking for a feminist tale is going to be disappointed (also to note: male director, male writer, original book written by a man, you get the gist). but despite the simplification of womanhood, there’s still lots to love. like how this movie takes a general concept about the chaos of life & relationships and maintaining hope & joy throughout it all, and infuses said concept with roald dahl-esque fantasy, whimsy & childlike wonder. emma stone did her best acting performance to date and overall i had a good time!!!",28 Dec 2023,8,1116,9,26,1116
"Sick to my stomach.Ok, so you imprison a woman, and then cut her apart, replace her brain with a baby’s, and masquerade her as a sex starved feminist icon of sexual liberation?Under a thick layer of production design is grotesque plot goo. Don’t be fooled. This Frankenstein-Barbie disaster goes nowhere, solves nothing, and is a prime example of male perspective feminism, focusing narrowly on a woman’s sexuality by infantilizing her, imprisoning her, exploiting her, and literally taking away her brain. This art fluff is so far from a consent, I could barely watch.",20 Dec 2023,1,1106,2,121,1106

i love how much time we spend just watching bella explore and experience lisbon - and the ship only a few scenes later - because i feel like films are rarely given that special space to breathe and merelyexistthese days. a lesser movie (and one with more studio interference) would’ve cut those scenes out because they “don’t explicitly move the plot forward” to give it a “tighter edit” and “faster pacing.” but when you leave scenes like these…,27 Dec 2023,0,4812,21,512,4812

frankenbarbie,30 Sep 2023,0,4469,102,6786,4469
"POOR THINGS is the most technically dazzling film Yorgos Lanthimos has constructed. A sexually liberating, imaginative tale of reawakening & discovery featuring the best performance of Emma Stone’s career. Mark Ruffalo has never been funnier. The production and costume design is exemplary while Tony McNamara’s screenplay contains so much foul-mouthed and ingenious wordplay I want to watch it again just to catch all the lines I missed from laughing. A sensational triumph all around.",02 Sep 2023,9,2531,63,195,2531

"You could pause this film at any point and get one of the best frames of the year. Some of the year's finest use of colour and space. I absolutely loved the lens choices and the way they changed throughout, allowing full and complete immersion. It's exactly like looking at a moving canvas. And, for the most part, I adored everything about it. I do agree with the critique that the feminist liberation commentary is highly male gaze, one that…",12 Jan 2024,8,2976,84,408,2976

"a grotesque picaresque! a phallic phantasmagoria. a ballad, a battle cry, a bildungsroman. words can be anything you want them to! Bella Baxter has seized upon this notion and inhaled it with gusto like a flaky pastry. she moves with a jerky insouciance across London, Lisbon, Alexandria, Paris, eager to sculpt every cell of her malleable mind, body and soul.she is shameless. she is reckless. she is underworked and oversexed, pulsing, beating, bursting through the fleshy walls of God’s…",26 Oct 2023,9,2724,44,339,2724

"Poor ThingsOne star for the production design, costumes, hair and makeup, music, and acting. A perverted view of a woman “coming into her own” by a slew of men writers and filmmakers who focus more on the gratuitous sex and cinematography than the storytelling. Knowing all of Bella’s origins within the first 20-minutes of the movie made the rest seem entirely predictable and revelations she made of her own being unremarkable, unmoving.And are we saying a woman’s understanding…",09 Dec 2023,2,277,21,13,0

"New York Film Festival 61: Poor ThingsThe film boasts stunning visuals that left me in awe, and the performances by Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo were nothing short of exceptional, making ""Poor Things"" a true standout of the festival for me. Ruffalo steals the show with his comedic performance. While Emma Stones absence from the screening was a bummer, Yorgos Lanthimos was there, proving to be surprisingly chill despite his wild films.Based on Alasdair Gray’s novel, Lanthimos delves…",29 Sep 2023,0,2781,24,66,2781
"„Formidable“Mein Herz tanzt! Ich möchte aufstehen und jubeln, weil Kino und Film manchmal, nur manchmal, so verzücken können, dass ich tief im Inneren ein Kribbeln spüre. Weil jedes Bild ein kleines Kunstwerk ist, weil die Grenzen von Sehgewohnheiten und Geschmack ein kleines Stück verschoben werden. Weil das, was gesagt wird, berührt und begeistert. Und weil wie es gesagt wird, in Staunen versetzt.„Poor Things“ ist purstes Kino und schlicht große Kunst. Ein Film über die Emanzipation von Geist und…",18 Oct 2023,5,3060,16,19,3060

"I’ve just learned that the movie gets rid of the part in the book where Candle is the one essentially telling the story through his perspective (the male fantasy) and that at the end of his story Bella calls his version of events out as untruthful.This changes everything.

"Yorgos Lanthimos films have always been as liberating as they are suffocating. As obsessed with rules as they with breaking them. His characters always hellbent on defying the worlds they’ve been presented. With this in mind, it was only a matter of time until Lanthimos tackled sexuality and individual expression.When we hear the phrase “poor things” it’s hard not to picture children. Innocent creatures bound to have their very innocence stripped from them. In actuality the poorest thing of…",30 Dec 2023,9,1441,15,77,1441

"The most monstrous of all fates is the lack of agency over one’s own destiny.For gothic heroines, their ends are written into their genre; the choice of individualism, or of romantic love. To choose a man is almost always to choose death.This is where the story of “Poor Thing’s” Bella Baxter begins: choosing death, of her past. Where her storycontinues— is a rebirth into the self - through romantic and into post romantic thought; finding external…",11 Dec 2023,0,3919,25,299,3919

"A Picaresque joy; wherein a strong (Freudian) sex drive eventually gives way to personal agency and body and mind autonomy. Forget Barbie and Ken, Emma Stone gives the doll-come-to-life performance of the year and Mark Ruffalo does all the Kenisms with obscenity. Truly two great and fully committed comedic performances in a movie that lives very much in Terry Gilliam's skin but (unlike his films) never runs off the rails. The absurdist colors and costumes dress up a Pinocchio and…",03 Sep 2023,9,5586,48,416,5586
"A partir de um olhar contemporâneo para o clássico, Yorgos Lanthimos constrói sua narrativa de contrastes. Quando fui ver o filme, não sabia que era baseado num livro que se inspira em Frankenstein de Mary Shelley, mas isso logo fica evidente nos caminhos que a trama toma de início, além da explícita inspiração de Lanthimos em histórias clássicas do cinema de terror, como pode ser percebido na influência do Expressionismo Alemão principalmente na primeira parte do longa.

She discovers pleasure through an exciting relationship with a troublesome man. She self-actualizes through sex work, queerness, and socialism.

It's easily…",10 Dec 2023,8,1958,22,191,1958
"You can stuff it in unending lace and ruffles, but an overly simplistic worldview is an overly simplistic worldview. This feels like an acting exercise gone wrong, and while I love the production design, it still doesn’t manage to distract from the fact that the film simply doesn’t know what to do with Bella once she’s no longer a child. Enthusiasm isn’t empowerment, and the movie doesn’t even make a stab at answering the “so what?” that comes after Bella takes control.",16 Dec 2023,4,1594,26,236,1594
direção de figurino radiante; fulgurante; resplandecente. desde o maria antonieta da coppola ninguém presta tanta atenção ao tecido. gostei que o yorgos surfou na onda do chroma key e em vez de meter um fundo realista meio artificial fez logo um negócio obviamente artificial e ficou muito mais realista. se é que eu me faço entender,06 Feb 2024,9,972,5,49,8603

And I don't think Yorgos has compromised his vision, either! He's simply been able to find ways to mould style into something palatable to the masses, which is, somehow, an elaborately overdesigned film shot mostly in wide-angle lenses that feature a Frankenstein monster having a lot of sex.

Yorgos Lanthimos is a director whose style I’ve come to really like. I know his style isn’t for everyone but I really like his style of weirdness mixed with dark comedy at times. Killing of a Sacred Deer was great and underrated in my opinion and I absolutely adored The Favourite so I was very much anticipating his next project.

Thoughtfully it explores ideas of class, sexuality, gender roles, science, childlike innocence, and how to find hope in a cruel world, all while simply being just a really entertaining film.2023",29 Dec 2023,9,1463,24,253,1463

This isn't empowerment this is borderline paedophilia.And why is it that when she was more childlike they made her sex crazed yet when she showed signs of actual growth and maturity they strayed away from that aspect of her character to the point she was disinterested. Why is hypersexuality being associated with children in any way?,20 Jan 2024,1,46,12,5,0

"Yorgos Lanthimos is not a director who strives to make approachable films, and they are very often uncomfortable at best, with occasional moments that will test even the most seasoned arthouse aficionados. He purposely employs Brechtian techniques to distance the audience from the characters, whether through stilted, unnatural dialog or unusual camera techniques.

His films prior toThe Favouritewere absurd affairs that saw socialization as deceitfully arbitrary, romantic love as a dubious prospect amidst overwhelming alienation, and the family — that old reliable stand-in for society at-large — as a dysfunctional body.If his last effort brought a thaw to the Greek director’s icy performances and detached visual style,Poor Thingscould be his version of a tropical vacation.

Yayınlandığından itibaren büyük ses getiren Poor Things’i sonunda deneyimleyebildim. Victorian-Steampunk temasında ilerleyen film aslında Bella’nın gelişim sürecini ele alıyor. Çocukluktan yetişkinliğe olan serüveninde birden çok maceraya atılıyor. Tabii burada önemli olan kimsenin baskısı olmadan kendi benliğini oluşturması. Emma Stone’un muhteşem performansı ile harika betimleniyor. Birden çok cesurca sahnesi olmasına rağmen pek rahatsız etmiyor. Yorgos’un filmografisine hakim olanlar zaten buna alışıktır. Emma’nın performansı da Oscar ile taçlandırılacaktır.Mark Ruffola’nın rolü de biraz şaşırtıcı. Kendisinden alışılık olmadığımız performans. Emma ile iyi ikili…,12 Feb 2024,9,2334,39,173,2334

"With its Star Wars aesthetic and 2001 sensibility, Dune will put willing viewers under a sci-fi trance. The movie—a second attempt to adapt Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, after David Lynch’s disastrous 1984 Dune—rumbles and buzzes in your ears while presenting vast alien landscapes and massive, levitating spacecraft before your eyes. There’s a tactile quality to the film—the way softly glowing lamps float alongside characters in dark hallways or fabrics drape around them and flicker violently in the wind—that makes everything…",11 Oct 2021,7,1624,19,432,1624

It’s one of those rare movies that fully transported me to another world. I must also thank Villeneuve for not getting rid of the weirdness of theDunestory, as my biggest worry was that it was going to feel too ‘Hollywood’. If Part 2 can match or even be better than this, then the two movies will be one of the greatest sci-fi epics in cinema history.",06 Dec 2021,9,2636,20,85,2636

"insane how much I can care about something i know so little about. I’ve never been so confused but simultaneously so entranced by a film experience as much as I was in this. This is bound to warrant a multitude of rewatches, and those will be welcome. Denis Villeneuve continues to prove his greatness, as this has some of the most rich atmosphere and beautiful cinematography in any sci-fi film, and I would argue more than most films period.

"Finally had a chance to watch this on the big screen and it definitely impressed more this time. I still find it more visually impressive than narratively - the film is straitjacketed to the original story in a way that allows for few surprises of the Lynchian variety, it’s utterly lacking in sex appeal (Villeneuve suffers from Nolan syndrome in that regard), and all the dream/vision sequences fall pretty flat (and there are a LOT of them).

Denis continued obsession with upending the heroic protagonist is clearly a big reason he was driven to this material.

"Twee uur durende parfumreclame. Knip de film in stukken van 30 seconden en eindig het iedere keer met ‘By Paco Rabanne’.Langdradig, saai, emotieloos, alles is oranje, vervelende dreunscore van Hans Zimmer.Ik blijf er bij. Dennis Villeneuve maakt gewoon mooie plaatjes voor saaie films net zoals Blade Runner 2047.Zijn beste film blijft Prisoners want dat had tenminste een verhaal.Ik had het boek klaar liggen.

"Between this, Arrival, Enemy, and Blade Runner 2049 , I have noticed Villeneuve tells stories that seem like distant observations of humanity - they seem objective and psychological, as if they were studies/observations of someone or something that walks amongst them unseen or watches from a distance, never interacting. The details and emotional complexities are seen but never felt.

Figured this could go one of two ways.One: the film leans into the comedy of “Much Ado About Nothing” and dials the “we’re an adaptation” energy up to 12. Over the top across the board in the most delightfully earnest of ways.Two: the film uses “Much Ado About Nothing” as merely a skeleton to build something entirely new and modern on. Familiar nods appear but it’s otherwise its own thing.Turns out there was a secret third option…,03 Jan 2024,5,3666,55,546,3666

Was going to be nice and give it a 2 star but the more I thought about it the more I got annoyed at something in the movie…Sydney Sweeney very talented for streaming services shows…she could be such a HBO/apple series favourite but someone is telling her to do theatrical releases with shitty movies and she won’t thrive until she gets into that drama series bag.Glen Powell…not addressing that 🙏🏿,22 Dec 2023,3,88,3,44,0
"I think ""Anyone But You"" is perfect for fans of cheesy 2000s rom-coms.While the plot isn't the most overtly romantic, it's really fun and hilarious to see how their fake relationship works. The writing is surprisingly clever for a rom-com as if they truly understand the formula for an enjoyable one. The two leads, Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, are both hilarious and attractive, and their chemistry is excellent. Their ""hotness scene"" is fire. Among many great scenes, the airplane sequence tops my list as the funniest one.Overall, this film works fine as a modern rom-com.",28 Dec 2023,8,1749,54,1734,1749

I cringed at her attempt of humor.  It didn't work.The film nosedived into a mundane ball of cheese and cliché during the third act.  There's nothing fresh about it and the hopes of it reviving the RomCom subgenre were... um, ok.Blah.  At least the gorgeous Sydney, Australia is showcased nicely.  5/10.",27 Dec 2023,5,1365,38,705,1365

It may not be the single greatest film of all time, but it was still pretty enjoyable. I just wish I wasn’t single.",30 Dec 2023,6,1565,70,2089,1565

The commitment to the Shakespeare source material is all over the place, and it’d be better if it went harder in either direction.

At this point, the end goal is to make something fun and entertaining with moments that make you laugh and smile through and through. This does just that.This is a fun movie.

"Watching this movie was a slap in the face after some of the things I thought it would be. Glenn Powell's performance infused each scene with comedic mastery. Conversely, Sydney Sweeney's portrayal, while competent, lacked the nuanced comedic finesse one might anticipate. Nevertheless, as a cinematic escapade, it suffices for a pleasant diversion. I really recommend it!",23 Dec 2023,6,877,47,233,0

Not trying to be a hater but idk it didn’t do it for me. I did laugh a couple of times. It wasn’t horrible. But it wasn’t great. Personally I might have liked it more with different leads.

"Powell and Sweeney’s strong chemistry less buoys the movie than highlights the script’s weak contrivances, even accepting fluffy rom com logic. Their supposed antagonism is never convincing, and their romantic rivals are purely functional until discarded. The best scene is the most straightforward, the least burdened by faux-naughtiness and dull thorns, when the pair fall into Sydney harbour and trade vulnerabilities. Uncomplicated and well-performed fantasy with tourist board money. The special cocktails that Hoyts serves at premieres are uniformly disgusting blue things but they’re free so I gobble them down like free +1 tickets to premieres. Shout out to the Anyone But You premiere DJ.",18 Dec 2023,3,5876,65,304,5876

"The success of a rom-com hinges significantly on the compelling chemistry between its main protagonists, as the genre's often clichéd narratives are sustained by the emotional resonance between characters. Will Gluck's approach in casting the current sensations, Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, was strategically sound; however, the execution fell short as the pair exhibited negligible on-screen chemistry. The emotional dynamics appeared more scripted than genuine, rendering performances that felt robotic and devoid of the expected mushiness inherent in the genre. This lack of chemistry represents a missed opportunity to elevate the film's appeal within the rom-com genre eventually.",24 Jan 2024,3,1098,28,440,1098

"The good:1. Based on Shakespeare!2. Lesbian wedding!3. Unwritten needle drop/montage!The bad:1. Too many dumb contrived scenarios, and I know that’s the basis of a romcom, but this was pushing it to the extreme.2. Cringey dialogue at times, I felt myself literally cringe at a few of the lines.3. I think Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney had good-ish chemistry, but for some reason I wasn’t buying Sydney in this role. I don’t think she’s…",06 Feb 2024,6,359,24,106,0
I went into this movie thinking it was gonna be terrible based on the mixed reviews but I really enjoyed it.Classic rom-com formula with the enemies to lovers trope but I really like the idea of how it unfolded in the movie.

I also appreciate that there is a lesbian couple getting married. 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩Bonus for Glen Powell and Daren Barnett’s fine asses. 🥵Another bonus for my childhood song getting a well deserved revival akaUnwrittenby Natasha Bedingfield.(giving it four stars because Bea’s parents are fucking annoying),06 Feb 2024,8,196,22,28,0
