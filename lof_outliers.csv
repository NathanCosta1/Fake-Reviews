You can stuff it in unending lace and ruffles but an overly simplistic worldview is an overly simplistic worldview This feels like an acting exercise gone wrong and while I love the production design it still doesn t manage to distract from the fact that the film simply doesn t know what to do with Bella once she s no longer a child Enthusiasm isn t empowerment and the movie doesn t even make a stab at answering the so what that comes after Bella takes control,,1

Liberation from societyPoor Thingsworks so wonderfully as a story of a woman escaping the clutches of patriarchy to reclaim herself Though a second watch really affirmed for me that the film offers little else when it comes to wider politics The fight between choosing cynicism or kindness is still basic and a sidestep to avoid being specific about beliefs and values YetPoor Thingsstill works because of its immersive design and strange humour Its a unique experience ,1.0086145081977633,0
Shelley s Frankenstein combined with Voltaire s Candide as a vile pseudo feminist pastiche of asinine dark humor and hysterical pictorialism Quite unbearable to watch given its grotesque use of very wide and very long lenses and full of imbecilic ideas both formal and thematic Lanthimos huckery whimsical fable of counterfeit idiosyncrasy would probably be more offensive if it wasn t so pathetic,1.1022498833302168,0

It rules that the director of DOGTOOTH has levelled up to being an artist whose newest work can play to a packed theatre of blue hairs that are totally into his vibe laughing it up as Mark Ruffalo makes funny faces in between Emma Stone nuding it up And I dont think Yorgos has compromised his vision either Hes simply been able to find ways to mould style into something palatable to the masses which is somehow an elaborately overdesigned film shot mostly in wideangle lenses that feature a Frankenstein monster having a lot of sex Plus tons of zoomsJess Franco would be proud,1.1799822625299188,0

This is a tremendous piece of art and definitely my favorite movie of 2023 I don t tend to get deep on this app that s what ig is for but there is some sort of rawness and to some extent tenderness of the idea of rediscovering the world once again for all its beauty and all its danger After watching this I find myself thinking about how we once were so naive so innocent so trusting of the things around us ,1.0662809276726704,0

Despite the gratuitous gore and sex there was no mention of periods and only twice were the physical risks associated with prostitution even brought up Given how Bella s sexual assault is presented as part of her liberation a key theme seems to be that if you take pleasure from sexual exploitation it s empowering rather than invasive Bella s intellectual growth is aided by a woman but she is cast aside in favor of her male companion who teaches Bella about poverty ,1.0391607595398005,0

Poor thingsis a difficult film for me to understand and appreciate On one hand the film is extremely weird and unusual which should allow for a great level of nuance and depth to both the story and its messaging On the other hand I can t help but feel like the film was disappointingly simple with its narrative approach I think that its unique and mad visual style and unhinged performances and dialogue had the opportunity to allow for a more cryptic and openended narrative Everything comes together almost too obviously from both its story progression and its messaging,1.6082598702620914,0

Welp I finally watched it My most anticipated film of 2023And that s saying a lot during a year in which Scorsese Nolan Fincher Wes Anderson and more are ALL dropping bangers left and right THIS was what I was looking forward to the most I ve seen Yorgos Lanthimos other works like The Lobster The Favourite and Sacred Deer and I always really enjoy his incredibly dark and dry sense of humor But when the trailer for Poor Things dropped ,1.157963697996428,0

 I need to offer something to the world and yet I have nothing Poor Things by Yorgos Lanthimos could almost be described as an odyssey one where a woman who before saw no way forward in her life gets an unexpected chance to have another tryIt is a fascinating experience to get to rediscover our world through Bella Baxter s eyes watching her go from naive and helpless prisoner to an independent free spirit who knows what she wants and ,1.5726599957102212,0

Poor Things is a delicious little movie set in a big curious world Yorgos Lanthimos latest film is a continuation of his meditation on developmental manipulation and telling stories about people doing fucked up stuff to each other but this time its wrapped in a completely new veneer Completely visually distinct from his previous works Poor Things builds a world that reflects its protagonists perspective first existing exclusively within the walls of her creators home then broadening to a fisheye ,1.0340676964869782,0

Poor Things ist wie eine Leinwand die Yorgos Lanthimos nutzt um ein wundersch√∂nes wie in Wasserfarben illustriertes emanzipatorisches Werk zu zaubernPoor Things ist vieles aber neben seiner audiovisuellen Perfektion eines n√§mlich verdammt witzig Emotional wird man auf dieser wilden Achterbahnfahrt mal so richtig durchger√ºttelt Ekel Faszination Humor alles ist mit dabeiDer Film ist dabei aber nicht nur pures Eye Candy sondern erz√§hlt im Kern die Geschichte wie Bella Baxter als Frau heranreift und sich unter dem Patriarchat emanzipiertVoll mit Witz voll mit wundersch√∂nen Bildern und voll mit Liebe ist Poor Things in meinen Augen als Gesamtwerk absolut grandios,1.4840023639680617,0

Like a 35 million dollar Guy Maddin film but unfortunately with Guy Maddin being replaced by a guy whose cinema is not driven by a love of images but by a terribly literal imagination At times the combined relentlessness of Lanthimos Stone and Ruffalo results in bursts of manic expressivity I can appreciate Also at least in this one the discursive overeagerness of recent art filmmaking is blown up to fittingly baroque proportions Its still a chore mostly Beyond terrible score too,1.191800040099827,0

Emma Stone delivers a fantastic performance here in a way that makes Bella s wild transformation over the course of the film wildly believable for a Frankenstein smonster type of character The whole cast in this film is brilliant but I do really enjoy the wacky and stylistic world building by Yorgos Lanthimos as well Stone and Ruffalo s impression of his voice is hilarious,1.1175760897601625,0

Unfortunately its quite sunk by being 40 minutes too long a story that couldve been told in 23rds of the time and without having certain characters exist only to state the films thesis Funny when Stone is locked in her doing a reverse American Pie with raw apples and no shame and a little sluggish when other characters are doing most of the talking Margaret Qualley is barely in this and it feels like a waste of her casting just ,1.1536650117123606,0

First watch of 2024 and god am I happy to be kicking the new year off in the theater withFrankenBarbie I can t even lie I haven t been this happy watching a film from start to finish like this in a long time Fuck that was fun Stunning production and costume design brilliant scoreGotta be a career best for Emma Stone tooMagically weird dazzling and provocative A quirky display of macabre and sexual filmmaking that I will definitely be thinking about for the next few days,,1
I have a lot of respect for Poor Things A few concessions Yorgos is wearing his style thin the CGI is claustrophobic and ugly and rarely do things turn out like this for freewilled women I understand why its utopianism would not resonate for many Yet I still yearn for stories that affirm the quest for women s selfhood without tragedy But perhaps it would be better framed as a humanist rather than feminist filmBella s liberation is not based in ,1.1472866123874588,0

Quite sharp funny and daring at the onset but runs out of gas halfway through its second act coasting for the final hour mostly on the strength of the performances in lieu of further narrativecharacter development Ultimately it is a bit too simplistic straightforward and long winded to rank amongst Lanthimoss strongest efforts but its an entertaining sometimes hilarious occasionally astonishing film,1.2013718937498603,0

There were strange parallels between myself and the central protagonist She had a childlike wonder for the world developed an interest in philosophy and became a socialist Familiar traits to those who know meThe filmmaking approach enhanced the experience from its wide angle lenses to its LED backdrops processing life through Bella s perspective It was a film surreal and fantastical A whimsy delight with lots on its mind for audiences to ponderHowever the attempted English accents by US actors were ghastly so not all perfect Regardless this one is definitely worth seeing on the big screen,1.0801874465886645,0

In which Yorgos deposits his blank check and descends into meandering selfparody flailing about from repeated wisecrack to repetitive punchline It aims for the madcap whimsy of the best Burtons with a sexual edge but by the time its thoroughly overworked and poorly paced narrative is through you ll find yourself admiring Emma Stone s admittedly stellar performance and little else A massive disappointment from the heights ofThe LobsterandThe Favourite,,1
I find myself in a tricky spot with Poor Things On one hand its a transfixing fantasia that showcases the astonishing collaboration of Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos There is no doubt that this duo is going to give us many masterpieces for years to come enabling and deepening each others most unique creative instincts On the other I find that Lanthimos hyper absurdist take on the Frankenstein story has its limits when it tries to delve into territory deeper ,,1

I dont really know anything about Dune lore so I found the actual story pretty boring Sort of hard to make a movie about premonitions that arent fulfilled before you stand up to go That said I was fascinated by the imperial culture and all the traditions and such It makes sense to me that over a long period of time humanity would return to rank and ritual This seems more plausible than the Star Trek future of nerds going on field trips Well I guess this movie is about a nerd going on a field trip too but you get my meaning,1.0330466385600046,0

Dune is a masterfully crafted and executed picture Denis Villeneuve does everything to capture this complex universe and its unique essence All the technical aspects are perfect from the mindblowing cinematography to the stunning score that perfectly balances every scene The story is very intriguing and touches on different themes ranging from colonization and war to notions of evil and good The pacing is well managed neither too rushed nor too slow the characters are intricate and engage the audience ,1.125507995102932,0
A symphonic grand introspective that solidifies beauty within each second Denis Villeneuve s primary focus is on scale but it s impressive how fleshed out and sympathetic our main characters feel I was able to bring myself together whenever I felt that I dragged a bit because of the intentions and layers within the protagonist It s a film that grew on me as it went on and although I do think it took itself too seriously at times it was definitely impressive and mostly engagingIf I had to shower by rubbing sand against my ass I would simply choose to smell bad,1.5603008283305944,0
Rating on this is necessarily provisional this really is a part one But I really enjoyed it I said this after Blade Runner 2049 came out but Dune solidifies it Villenueve is our man for impossible difficultylevel scifi movies Blade Runner 2 sounds like a joke Story of Your Life is 100 unfilmable Dune is a land war in Asia And yetVillenueve can be pretty sterile and I was worried that his version of Dune would not have enough ,1.335012394087872,0
THE DEFINITIVE IMAX FILMIts one of those once in a blue moon type movies Denis Villeneuve s vision is evident in every frame Here is a director who can finally realise the ambition of Herberts epic which has long been considered unfilmable a point proven by disappointing and forgettable attempts on both the big and small screens in the past It helps if youve read the books but its not essential given how screenwriters making the dense story more accessible ,,1
 Dune was a fantastic cinematic experience It captivated me from beginning to end The music by Hans Zimmer is a big highlight too so be sure to watch it in a good theaterThe film is very different to your typical Hollywood blockbuster experience Which is refreshing and fascinating to watchBut therein lie some problems too While the movie takes its time to introduce you into its world and characters it sometimes lacks the suspense excitement and emotionality you would ,1.0302530314928315,0

This was undeniably epic But not in the way Herbert probably intended VilleneuvesDuneis told from a whole other perspective than the book It stems from a mind craving actionpacked sequences and technical grandeur a mind keen to please a public eye trained by the likes of the MCU Attempting to amalgamate that mindset with Herberts text which makes a point of avoiding wordy descriptions of fights and focusing instead on the power play and the political machinations is ,1.0036969099931412,0

Villeneuve sticks pretty closely to the novel so no real point in getting into thematic areas in writing about Dune Part One since those elements have been discussed thousands of times But splitting the first novel of the series into two parts is a clever gambit it allows this film to be virtually plotless for its first half allowing the film to become little more than an accumulation of details and information about these worlds the ecosystems within them ,,1

At the level of spectacle DUNE is a visual feast for the senses a magnificent exercise in what everyone likes to call worldbuilding and a terrific opportunity to lean further into what that nebulous phrase pure cinema might mean It is a film that is never lacking in ambition nor immensity nor grand imagery and its certainly not hard to be impressed by the sheer level of craft on display The combination of artistry and ambiance is always majestic courtly ,1.5274187325064594,0

Anticipation is not merely a word to describe my longing for this film Denis Villeneuve is one of my favourite filmmakers and he does know how to make the viewers awestruck with immersive visual driven cinematic experience Its not perfect or grounded because we havent yet apprehended towards the whole saga Dune once considered unfilmable and two auteurs Jodorowsky and Lynch even failed in the attempts The worldbuilding is just insanely meticulous and sophisticated As Im not familiar with books ,1.2069820233028912,0
Scale and tone are perfect Bare minimum exposition Im on board for anything Dune even the Lynch and TV miniseries have their merits but this is the best adaptation yet A droning bummer sometimes literally as Hans Zimmers portentous drone fills the room covering up whispered dialog and ornithopter flutter only interrupted by embarrassing ethnic wailing drama cues that should have stopped being used after the 100th action movie of the 00s played that card We get it the Fremen are kinda Arabic Paul Atreides is such a weird hero Just confused and angry and destined for tragedy Fun,1.019974726762687,0

Soooo this was definitely part one of a series not that the advertising has made that clear Rather than a selfcontained story it feels chapter 1 of an ongoing saga which isnt necessarily a bad thing but the pacing is all over the place There were characters and moments which were given small moments and scenes to make an impact and then big epic moments didnt quite landAlso and I cant get this out of my head Stellan Skarsgaard ,1.0313639666973393,0

Villeneuve is such an interesting director to me and an even more interesting choice to helm something as revered as Herberts Dune He started his feature filmography off with doing miserable nihilistic crime riffs with big reveals and twists reminiscent of a Fincher type but quickly grew to more abstract concepts withEnemy He made one more of those nihilistic exercises inSicariobefore expanding upon his abstract experiences and leaning into more romantic tendencies leading toBlade Runner 2049 where ,1.133556267686423,0

Renowned auteur Denis Villeneuve proves to be one of the new gods of science fiction yet again with Dune Part One which may very well be his greatest and certainly most ambitious achievement to date doing considerable justice to Frank Herberts seminal source material by way of outstanding performances breathtaking visuals magnificent production design heartracing setpieces wonderfully adapted characters and some of the best and most audacious worldbuilding in a blockbuster in years,1.2486053588207182,0
So Villeneuve seems to never miss because this Dune kinda rocks It s so undeniably epic in scale and that sound design reached deep into my soul man One thing it handles a lot better than Lynch s take is all the information it s gotta deliver they present this really dense world in a more digestible way that pulled me in from the start This story really seems to demand a lot of care and artistry and damn they really brought it Sorry to gush but no notes here that was excellent Jason Momoa stole the show for me and so much orange 2021 Ranked httpsboxditb8ksU,1.0540407038026607,0

Absolutely loved the intense experience The score was probably my favorite aspect with the imagery being a close secondI couldn t give it 5 stars because of the obvious flaws One of the biggest being its struggle with being personal However it also seems like the book was so dense that some characters missed out on the ability to have personal story lines in favor of fitting the main plot points in the run time of the movie Maybe should have been told in 3 or 4 parts ,1.008741005387044,0

Dune is an atmospheric epic with it s heart buried under the sand As entranced in a sound bath of Hans Zimmer and enveloped in hues of Denis as I was I m left wanting more Which is insane considering the size of this production the stellar casting and every minute detail on the vast desert dunes still I m in awe of how fucking sick it was Just to sit in the theater and be completely immersed in this made it that ,1.0576830707407423,0

Astonishing and very faithful to the books Villeneuve respects us all and his works most of all he is a true visionary artist So many scenes that keep running everyday in my mind but the greatest of all lies at the planet of the sardaukar warriors with their priests and the blood are bathing with it s a true Gigger art it s like a prelude for his works Astonishing Arabic music accompanies the whole dream Oceans of spice sand and sun baths hunting my dreams I love the fact and it intrigues me this sci fi film is full of political conspiracies,1.189242281045575,0

Like halfway through the movie it occurred to me that Timmy is gonna play Bob Dylan and then I tried to picture him sounding like Bob Dylan so every time he spoke in the movie I repeated the line in my head but in a Bob Dylan voice singing Tombstone Blues and every time he stopped talking I just imagined the chorus of Tombstone Blues and I did that for about 15 minutes and I think it made the movie a lot better,1.3304349335769483,0

This film is unquestionably one of the titans of modern day sciencefiction and yet another masterpiece by Denis Villeneuve who is one of the directors I find it easiest to connect with After following up Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 with this it cannot be denied that Villeneuve truly is a spearhead as it pertains to sciencefiction filmmakingThe way Paul Atreides is constantly overlooked and doubted in his mission to save the world makes him a character everyone wants ,1.1233206373443863,0

What I love from Dune directed by Denis Villeneuve is how he build a world with such calmness full of mystery gentle and strangely alluring which is the same style he use when directing Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival Here Denis succeeds in building a world of Dune in a smart and efficient way despite how complex it isThe cinematography here is fantastic in the hand of Greig Fraser and of course scoring by Hans Zimmer here is perfect haunting and mysterious that made us want to see more and more what will happen to the story and the charactersWatched on Cinemas,1.157828959643062,0

Dune is such a well made film Denis Villeneuve is a very imaginative and competent director but this film felt kind of rushed it was like he was afraid he wouldn t get the green light to make sequels so he tried to fit as much as he could into one film Maybe he wanted to make a trilogy or maybe even 5 movies but the budget is so big that he felt he had to make two films in order ,1.0946269264526047,0

Its well established that filmmakers can make very big things look very cool What seems to be the real challenge and one that Villeneuve either doesnt get or doesnt care for is directing the humans that give the medium the emotional weight around those very big things whether it be huge desert worms or brutal architechture or just lots and lots of sand in a way that doesnt drown or negate the human factor in favour of spectacle ,1.3378978206337575,0

No pense que me gustaria tanto DUNE es una pelicula que bien y te puede gustar o odiar la cosa es que tiene un problema al momento de querer adentrarte al mundo de la cinta y al tener un ritmo tedioso puede que no llegues a conectar del todo pero la verdad es que si te logra atrapar es una experiencia bastante disfrutable y la manera en la que Villanueve logra mover la historia y hacer que todo el mundo ,1.0072145672653232,0

Denis continued obsession with upending the heroic protagonist is clearly a big reason he was driven to this material It works best when we marvel in sheer weight of how prophecy could be manipulated into reality How religious figures are seeded as much as brought from nothingDefinitely agree this suffers from not being a full 5 hour cut of the full story but as a start to a hopefully epic story its beautiful and challenging and impactfulGod I hope Denis gets to make it to Dune Messiah It could trully be a masterpiece for the ages,1.063917248349432,0

 This is only the beginning Eighth seventh in IMAX viewing and it still manages to capture my entire imagination and attention for the entire runtime and more This time I found myself enamored by the framing of hands and how they are the creators and destroyers of our souls desiresPicked up even more elements of the past that Villeneuve incorporates and makes his own Lucas Kubrick Cameron and more are plainly visible but also reappropriated you fit this vision ,1.077886396081108,0

Timothee Chalamet is a very special boyI actually dont mind him that much and he does a decent job here Hes a bit outclassed by Rebecca Ferguson though not to mention Oscar IsaacBut whatever Villeneuve is such a strong directorial force that his actors almost regardless of their performances are buoyed by the incredible milieus he creates His worlds are so complete and compelling that the actors seem to be living inside of them not performing This is ,1.0132369301634325,0

The second I left the theater I wanted to turn around and immerse myself in this truly sprawling and alien megabudget miracle all over again A complete triumph of slow drone meditative scifi The perception altering Xperience Jodorowsky wanted to inject into multiplex minds worldwide Lynch s bold images burrowed deeper down and stretched brutalist stark to explore a distant future not too far removed from our imperialist presentI can t wait to slip under this movie s spell large and in charge in a theater again,1.2192951878424414,0

This generations lord of the rings again proving to studious that CGI does not have to look absolutely terrible when done with passion A star studded cast all of which bring exactly what they need to for the story Timothee chalametand zendaya also prove they both have the Midas touch and any project they touch is automatic gold Except euphoria season 2 hopefully the sequels really delve into the insane world of dune and we get to see just how insane Paul atreides gets,1.0012279202984629,0
It s actually a crime that Denis Villeneuve wasn t nominated I know everyone has said it already but rewatching this just made me realize how much of an achievement this is It s understandable why directors like Ryusuke Hamaguchi and Jane Campion were nominated but the world that Villeneuve creates feels so alive with its own environments politics machinery and even science It s nothing less than a realization of how movies can conjure up what we cannot and I will never not ,1.1019120033341023,0

Ill start with the least satisfying part first I recently rewatchedThe Fellowship of the Ring which had a similar trajectory an adaptation of an iconic book which hadnt been successfully done previously and required the first film to set things up for more to come But where Peter Jacksons film ended with a significant battle which then sees the heroes starting the next stage of their questDunefinishes with a lacklustre duel that then segues into aimless ,1.0214301675965047,0
As an avid scifi and fantasy reader I tried to get into Frank Herberts landmark 1965 novel when I was a teenager But it was too dense and slowmoving and I vaguely recall giving it away about twothirds into the book Then there was the 1984 disaster from David Lynch which I watched not long thereafter and that only served to vindicate my choice not to bother with the rest of the novel or the subsequent seriesAll of which ,1.2705332297657617,0

Spectacular in the most traditional sense of the word As someone who remembers feeling like I would perhaps never getDune this is probably what a perfect movie version looks like for me it takes something that Needs To Be Explained and sidesteps into just making it tactile palpable and experiential instead Its an example of epic filmmaking crafted with care creative design a genuine sense of scale and actually enough interpersonal authenticityIts hard to have much to say ,1.1065634713809653,0

CLICK HERE for my full video reviewHere s my honest takeDunewas a gorgeous looking film that will rack up the technical awards nominations The movie takes its time to build this world immerse the audience However there is a LOT of information to process without any clear endgame It ultimately felt like a prelude to the actual Dune movie that has yet to arrive I understand the book is huge but I didn t feel any real finality here ,0.9951393422846353,0
NYFF Film 3This is only the beginningIt is probably not by any means a shocking reveal to say thatDunehas been easily my most anticipated film of the last few years I was mostly unfamiliar with this world until really the past year or so but Denis Villeneuve has established himself as I think arguably the greatest director weve had working in the last decade with his incredible resume to back that up After finally finishing Frank ,1.0905793789947336,0
So glad I saw it again on the biggest loudest screen available before the new one comes out Incredible production supporting cast lighting sound and score contribute to an enthrallingly moody intricate alien universeIt feels like a copout but my ratings a full star pending future installments Storywise Id say Villeneuve has mostly successfully piloted us into an epic unwieldy tempest but Im very curious if he can land the plane and unsure how feasible I think that is considering how foggy my memory of the books is and how nowwellworn some of their ideas are,,1
Our plans are measured in centuriesIve been feeling like Id forgotten what big screen spectacle was meant to be for quite a while No longer IMAX is the saviour of cinema Im glad to witness its twin digital celluloid resurgencesTime has only strengthened my feelings that this is kind of a huge failure of adaptation its almost hard to believe that Villeneuve isnt lying when he says hes wanted to adapt this book since he was a kid ,1.1159828545005257,0

Watched the rerelease in DBox first time in cinemas COVID There s a near perfect scifi film here but I can t give it a perfect score the pacing is rough in the last half hour because of the inherent split of the source material totally necessary Villeneuve has directed several 5 star sci fi films though and have no doubt Part Two might increase my opinion of this as they ll go hand in hand it feels like this ends just as the action is starting But some sequences are mind blowing,1.030592776980137,0

Stern scifi mythmaking adapted from source material tailormade for Villeneuves meticulous visual sensibility The stonefaced approach occasionally clashes with the inherent weirdness of a story where dreams visions and prophecies abound Lynchs incoherent oddball imagining was perhaps more tuned into the novels weirdo wavelength but Villeneuves stratospheric ambition and devotion to the unwieldy text are intoxicating especially in a blockbuster landscape this dourFantastic,1.075574869183983,0

Anyone But Youappears to take a playful jab at Shakespeares Much Ado About Nothing and while it isnt the worst romcom Ive seen it falls short for me The chemistry between lead actors Sweeney and Powell is noticeably absent and the writing leans heavily on clich√©s bordering on what feels like a parody Despite its effort to maintain a light and playful tone the performances seem out of sync The film adheres to a familiar and predictable formula making it suitable for those seeking a runofthemill romcom experience However unless youre content with the mundane I hesitate to offer a recommendation,1.3860359836914298,0

Is it good Not really the internal logic is embarrassingly flawed it doesnt do nearly enough with its R rating and the constant references to Shakespeare only highlight how bad the dialogue can be but literally none of that matters when Glenn Powell and Sydney Sweeney are becoming genuine movie stars before your very eyes They sparkle and sizzle so brightly that you cant look at anything else and thats enough to make this a frisky fun holiday treat,1.070786430166475,0

Taking the films Shakespearean slant Anyone But You has a wickedly fun premise as Powell and Sweeney who once had a thing but cannot bear the sight of one another now begrudgingly lock eyes and fake flirt to create a ruse that theyre now head over heels in love Its a shame that the film takes nearly 40 minutes to make this happen though The chemistry between the central leads has its moments but with an uninspired script they cant ,1.123057743428864,0

Powell and Sweeney s strong chemistry less buoys the movie than highlights the script s weak contrivances even accepting fluffy rom com logic Their supposed antagonism is never convincing and their romantic rivals are purely functional until discarded The best scene is the most straightforward the least burdened by fauxnaughtiness and dull thorns when the pair fall into Sydney harbour and trade vulnerabilities Uncomplicated and wellperformed fantasy with tourist board money The special cocktails that Hoyts serves at premieres are uniformly disgusting blue things but they re free so I gobble them down like free 1 tickets to premieres Shout out to the Anyone But You premiere DJ,1.0115452839996149,0

The success of a romcom hinges significantly on the compelling chemistry between its main protagonists as the genres often clich√©d narratives are sustained by the emotional resonance between characters Will Glucks approach in casting the current sensations Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney was strategically sound however the execution fell short as the pair exhibited negligible onscreen chemistry The emotional dynamics appeared more scripted than genuine rendering performances that felt robotic and devoid of the expected mushiness inherent in the genre This lack of chemistry represents a missed opportunity to elevate the films appeal within the romcom genre eventually,1.0853306249004238,0

Very fun throwbackMuch Ado proves to be great text to build off of because it fits so well with 90s2000s romcom energy of characters embracing their contrived situation and hoping they can outthink their inevitable romanceAnd as a big plus since the movie isn t being super strict to Shakespeare it doesn t have to have the tonebreaking Don JohnIt s sweet funny and does really well at the romantic moments With this movie I like the central misunderstandings come from internal insecurities and selfdestruction not cosmic happenstances,1.0402735469390159,0

silly sexy fun and i love to see this kind of romcom back especially it being a modern day adaptation of a classic novelplay and i loved the way they incorporated a lot of the quotes from the original source material throughout too bad theyre not beating the no chemistry allegations other than that kiss WHEWW and with such a fanfiction script and tropes that i would love for a romcom but can only work and be pulled off if the leads have the chemistry for it which these two sadly do not,1.0231816717834838,0

Despite the low rating I did enjoy this I thought the supporting cast was wonderful particularly GaTa and Bryan Brown Would have enjoyed more of them all and less of Powell and Sweeney And nothing against those two individually I just didn t really buy their chemistry or the romcom reasons they kept being pulled apart,1.0656345868463344,0
