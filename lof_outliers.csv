Liberation from societyPoor Thingsworks so wonderfully as a story of a woman escaping the clutches of patriarchy to reclaim herself Though a second watch really affirmed for me that the film offers little else when it comes to wider politics The fight between choosing cynicism or kindness is still basic and a sidestep to avoid being specific about beliefs and values YetPoor Thingsstill works because of its immersive design and strange humour Its a unique experience ,1.003835684248576,0
Shelley s Frankenstein combined with Voltaire s Candide as a vile pseudo feminist pastiche of asinine dark humor and hysterical pictorialism Quite unbearable to watch given its grotesque use of very wide and very long lenses and full of imbecilic ideas both formal and thematic Lanthimos huckery whimsical fable of counterfeit idiosyncrasy would probably be more offensive if it wasn t so pathetic,1.0006258444549634,0

It rules that the director of DOGTOOTH has levelled up to being an artist whose newest work can play to a packed theatre of blue hairs that are totally into his vibe laughing it up as Mark Ruffalo makes funny faces in between Emma Stone nuding it up And I dont think Yorgos has compromised his vision either Hes simply been able to find ways to mould style into something palatable to the masses which is somehow an elaborately overdesigned film shot mostly in wideangle lenses that feature a Frankenstein monster having a lot of sex Plus tons of zoomsJess Franco would be proud,1.0047402848226117,0

Quite sharp funny and daring at the onset but runs out of gas halfway through its second act coasting for the final hour mostly on the strength of the performances in lieu of further narrativecharacter development Ultimately it is a bit too simplistic straightforward and long winded to rank amongst Lanthimoss strongest efforts but its an entertaining sometimes hilarious occasionally astonishing film,0.968154510692427,0

unpopular take but Lanthimos could be making all timers if he honed in his comedic and visual ingenuity the lenses in this are a delight and stopped trying to be self consciously Ostentatious and Important He gets such hysterical performances out of everyone here I want him to move towards screwball comedies not becoming a Ruben Ostlund ass best picture merchantStill lavish production absurdist soundstages occasionally downright weird and unexplained and gross in a way that feels antithetical to the glossy sterility of what s thriving right now Real freaks on real sets Loved it,1.0136461010451574,0

I know Dune is as technically perfect as any other Denis Villeneuve work but its also at the same time boring vapid and overlong Theres a reason why Ive been holding off reading Dune the book or watching the Lynch version and thats because everything about the story feels hopelessly boring and Villeneuves insanely hyped critically acclaimed version only reinforces my perception of itMy main critique of these largerthanlife actionpacked productions is the fact that they focus so much ,1.0116057046580003,0

I dont really know anything about Dune lore so I found the actual story pretty boring Sort of hard to make a movie about premonitions that arent fulfilled before you stand up to go That said I was fascinated by the imperial culture and all the traditions and such It makes sense to me that over a long period of time humanity would return to rank and ritual This seems more plausible than the Star Trek future of nerds going on field trips Well I guess this movie is about a nerd going on a field trip too but you get my meaning,1.0087067638996419,0

Review by David EhrlichIn the end Denis Villeneuve was all too right Your television isn t big enough for the scope of his Dune but that s only because this lifeless spice opera is told on such a comically massive scale that a screen of any size would struggle to contain it Likewise no story let alone the misshapen first half of one could ever hope to support the enormity of what Villeneuve tries to build over the course ,0.992183948245505,0
Despite the breathtaking colossal worldbuilding done by director Denis VilleneuveDune Part Onefeels hollow and premature to be even reviewed Adapting Frank Herbert s extremely dense unfilmable science fiction novel Villeneuve has done justice in the works by providing enough emotional heft and technical marvel to sustain Herbert s story But it s quite difficult to ascertain a film if it s purposely incomplete Dune Part Oneis one big preface from start to finish The actual story kicks in by the final ,0.9716773363825469,0

It s a credit to his talent as a filmmaker that Denis Villeneuve was able to corral Frank Herbert s sprawling book and make this finished film as accessible and cohesive as it is the source material is very ideas heavy and while that can make the iteration here seem a little dry at times it tells a streamlined version of the epic scifi story that I thought was engaging to see play outVilleneuve shot the film on location in Budapest ,0.9970744175907031,0

Duneis a meticulously crafted work of art by a filmmaker in Denis Villeneuve who seems to be at fullgrasp of the art and arriving at the peak of his powers The amount of detail into worldbuilding took a patient approach asking us as viewers to have that patienceAs Ive stated to people in socials do not come into this expectingStar Wars If you know anything about Villeneuves films is that his films are a slow burn where ,,1

Villeneuve ist mein absoluter Lieblingsregisseur Deswegen habe ich sehr viel von Dune erwartet Bei hohen Erwartungen läuft man natürlich immer in Gefahr herbe enttäuscht zu werden Also habe ich versucht nicht so heftig gehyped an Dune ranzugehen Ist mir leider nicht gelungen Ich habe viel erwartet Aber ich habe nicht erwartet dass ich nach 155 Minuten immer noch gespannt im Kinosessel sitze und nicht will dass dieser Film aufhört Mit voranschreitender Laufzeit habe ich mich immer wieder dabei erwischt Bitte ,0.9838193589797367,0

Renowned auteur Denis Villeneuve proves to be one of the new gods of science fiction yet again with Dune Part One which may very well be his greatest and certainly most ambitious achievement to date doing considerable justice to Frank Herberts seminal source material by way of outstanding performances breathtaking visuals magnificent production design heartracing setpieces wonderfully adapted characters and some of the best and most audacious worldbuilding in a blockbuster in years,0.9950405827396303,0

This movie spends absolutely no time getting you invested in anything that is happening They just say a bunch of things that mean nothing to the viewer and you re just supposed to be like ok sure All while you cant hear a damn thing theyre even saying They re just yelling in the sand and throwing spaceship porn at you while Hans Zimmer tries to make you care about a skinny white boy chosen one in 2021 And you shouldn t have ,0.9960010498310762,0

I think the criticisms of this movie as expositionstuffed and emotionally hollow ring true it s just that that s extremely cool to me As it turns out flawless special effects gorgeous cinematography original art direction incredibly detailed world building grand scale political storytelling Hans best score in YEARS meticulous sound design great performances from the entire cast a rigid faithfulness to the wildly popular and genredefining defying source material a lil kiss of psychedelia and Rebecca Ferguson being the hottest conventionally ,0.9978576409641168,0
A brutalist political space opera whose scale on the big screen at times is truly something to behold As with Villeneuve sBlade Runner 2049amidst the spectacle there is still something here that just feels empty and lifeless although with the former it connects with the themes presented in a more significant way For some this will be a triumphant viewing experience especially those with ties to the novel and the nostalgia for others this will be awe inducing to a degree but ultimately will feel meaningless and overlong,0.9937690359539353,0

Dune pasa por encima al espectador como pocas películas Villeneuve desarrolla con un pulso narrativo fuera de lo común una historia ultra inmersiva que poco a poco va resquebrajando el mundo que crea entre sueños profecías y traiciones que conforman una densa space óperaMe ha parecido algo inaudito ver una cosa tan monumental juega en todo momento con una ventaja enorme sobre ti pero con una exigencia sobre sí misma que es imposible no percibir Dune crea en sí ,0.9875537235881253,0

Denis continued obsession with upending the heroic protagonist is clearly a big reason he was driven to this material It works best when we marvel in sheer weight of how prophecy could be manipulated into reality How religious figures are seeded as much as brought from nothingDefinitely agree this suffers from not being a full 5 hour cut of the full story but as a start to a hopefully epic story its beautiful and challenging and impactfulGod I hope Denis gets to make it to Dune Messiah It could trully be a masterpiece for the ages,1.006033654240212,0

Duneis obviously limited by its format as an introductory and incomplete story which prevents it from reaching the heights ofArrivalandBlade Runner 2049who both packed strong narrative punches but its pretty much the best Dune Part One we could hope forWith the help of an entrancing score and imposing visuals youre quickly immersed in this complex world and the 155 minutes go by very quickly leaving you wanting so much more The table is set for part two and if it maintains the same quality as this one we could be looking at Villeneuves true masterpiece,1.0004205805362312,0
Well it took about 60 goddamn years but we finally got the visually stunning blockbuster epic of Dune that we always needed For me this fully embodies the world of Frank Herberts novel and looks like what I see when reading the text Villeneuve gets it artistically and knows exactly what images to fixate on darkened palace hallways burning palms lilywhite imperial armies dreams of the Fremen and endless expanse of desert sands Structured in a seminonlinear format the prophecies ,,1

I think Anyone But You is perfect for fans of cheesy 2000s romcomsWhile the plot isnt the most overtly romantic its really fun and hilarious to see how their fake relationship works The writing is surprisingly clever for a romcom as if they truly understand the formula for an enjoyable one The two leads Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are both hilarious and attractive and their chemistry is excellent Their hotness scene is fire Among many great scenes the airplane sequence tops my list as the funniest oneOverall this film works fine as a modern romcom,0.967750835930034,0

Powell and Sweeney s strong chemistry less buoys the movie than highlights the script s weak contrivances even accepting fluffy rom com logic Their supposed antagonism is never convincing and their romantic rivals are purely functional until discarded The best scene is the most straightforward the least burdened by fauxnaughtiness and dull thorns when the pair fall into Sydney harbour and trade vulnerabilities Uncomplicated and wellperformed fantasy with tourist board money The special cocktails that Hoyts serves at premieres are uniformly disgusting blue things but they re free so I gobble them down like free 1 tickets to premieres Shout out to the Anyone But You premiere DJ,,1

Too overt Trying too hard for uncanny perfection and in practicality missing it by a mile or more I would be embarrassed if I was the costume supervisor Not a single item of clothing fits Sydney Sweeney properly It s one thing to emphasize her boobs and it s another to be trying so hard to do so that you can t even bother to cover up the black pushup undergarment underneath her sage sports bra Stunts clearly overwhelmed the 25 million dollar ,,1

A very strange film inoys of ways Its quite naff but has glimpses of genuinely interesting ideas going on that make the naffness ever more frustratingIve not read Much Ado About Nothing but this seems like quite a departure from the tone of a Shakespearean romantic comedy Throughout there seems to be so much tension between the source material and modern romcom sensibilities and they never really resolveThe film also never really commits to how it characterizes its ,,1
