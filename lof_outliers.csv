Liberation from societyPoor Thingsworks so wonderfully as a story of a woman escaping the clutches of patriarchy to reclaim herself Though a second watch really affirmed for me that the film offers little else when it comes to wider politics The fight between choosing cynicism or kindness is still basic and a sidestep to avoid being specific about beliefs and values YetPoor Thingsstill works because of its immersive design and strange humour Its a unique experience ,1.003835684248576,0

It rules that the director of DOGTOOTH has levelled up to being an artist whose newest work can play to a packed theatre of blue hairs that are totally into his vibe laughing it up as Mark Ruffalo makes funny faces in between Emma Stone nuding it up And I dont think Yorgos has compromised his vision either Hes simply been able to find ways to mould style into something palatable to the masses which is somehow an elaborately overdesigned film shot mostly in wideangle lenses that feature a Frankenstein monster having a lot of sex Plus tons of zoomsJess Franco would be proud,1.0047402848226117,0

Poor thingsis a difficult film for me to understand and appreciate On one hand the film is extremely weird and unusual which should allow for a great level of nuance and depth to both the story and its messaging On the other hand I can t help but feel like the film was disappointingly simple with its narrative approach I think that its unique and mad visual style and unhinged performances and dialogue had the opportunity to allow for a more cryptic and openended narrative Everything comes together almost too obviously from both its story progression and its messaging,0.9940837010697046,0

In which Yorgos deposits his blank check and descends into meandering selfparody flailing about from repeated wisecrack to repetitive punchline It aims for the madcap whimsy of the best Burtons with a sexual edge but by the time its thoroughly overworked and poorly paced narrative is through you ll find yourself admiring Emma Stone s admittedly stellar performance and little else A massive disappointment from the heights ofThe LobsterandThe Favourite,1.0016743237953056,0

unpopular take but Lanthimos could be making all timers if he honed in his comedic and visual ingenuity the lenses in this are a delight and stopped trying to be self consciously Ostentatious and Important He gets such hysterical performances out of everyone here I want him to move towards screwball comedies not becoming a Ruben Ostlund ass best picture merchantStill lavish production absurdist soundstages occasionally downright weird and unexplained and gross in a way that feels antithetical to the glossy sterility of what s thriving right now Real freaks on real sets Loved it,1.0136461010451574,0

In the end Denis Villeneuve was all too right Your television isn t big enough for the scope of his Dune but that s only because this lifeless spice opera is told on such a comically massive scale that a screen of any size would struggle to contain it Likewise no story let alone the misshapen first half of one could ever hope to support the enormity of what Villeneuve tries to build over the course of these interminable 155 ,0.9918897941613715,0
Yes yes YESSSSSSSSSSDenis Villeneuve has this way of bypassing my absurdly short attention span in a way no other filmmaker can Every scene he shoots is so compelling through its presentation and atmosphere that its overall relevance to the larger story is a moot point I was glued to my seat during the entirety of what was arguably 2 and a half hours of setup But when the setup is this rich and nuanced and thoroughly engrossing how can ,0.9789736622452457,0

I dont really know anything about Dune lore so I found the actual story pretty boring Sort of hard to make a movie about premonitions that arent fulfilled before you stand up to go That said I was fascinated by the imperial culture and all the traditions and such It makes sense to me that over a long period of time humanity would return to rank and ritual This seems more plausible than the Star Trek future of nerds going on field trips Well I guess this movie is about a nerd going on a field trip too but you get my meaning,1.0087067638996419,0

DUNE is an attack on your movie senses in every great possible way a gigantic cinematic epic Its running time maybe hefty but its pleasures are deep and satisfying with rich lore and incredible world building Tho I can definitely understand some of the criticisms its definitely all setup with little narrative payoff in this first part But Pauls arc and his relationship with his mother really anchored this film in the best of ways All the actors killed it ,0.9983804774524868,0

Review by David EhrlichIn the end Denis Villeneuve was all too right Your television isn t big enough for the scope of his Dune but that s only because this lifeless spice opera is told on such a comically massive scale that a screen of any size would struggle to contain it Likewise no story let alone the misshapen first half of one could ever hope to support the enormity of what Villeneuve tries to build over the course ,0.992183948245505,0
Despite the breathtaking colossal worldbuilding done by director Denis VilleneuveDune Part Onefeels hollow and premature to be even reviewed Adapting Frank Herbert s extremely dense unfilmable science fiction novel Villeneuve has done justice in the works by providing enough emotional heft and technical marvel to sustain Herbert s story But it s quite difficult to ascertain a film if it s purposely incomplete Dune Part Oneis one big preface from start to finish The actual story kicks in by the final ,0.9716773363825469,0

It s a credit to his talent as a filmmaker that Denis Villeneuve was able to corral Frank Herbert s sprawling book and make this finished film as accessible and cohesive as it is the source material is very ideas heavy and while that can make the iteration here seem a little dry at times it tells a streamlined version of the epic scifi story that I thought was engaging to see play outVilleneuve shot the film on location in Budapest ,0.9970744175907031,0

Duneis a meticulously crafted work of art by a filmmaker in Denis Villeneuve who seems to be at fullgrasp of the art and arriving at the peak of his powers The amount of detail into worldbuilding took a patient approach asking us as viewers to have that patienceAs Ive stated to people in socials do not come into this expectingStar Wars If you know anything about Villeneuves films is that his films are a slow burn where ,,1

Villeneuve is such an interesting director to me and an even more interesting choice to helm something as revered as Herberts Dune He started his feature filmography off with doing miserable nihilistic crime riffs with big reveals and twists reminiscent of a Fincher type but quickly grew to more abstract concepts withEnemy He made one more of those nihilistic exercises inSicariobefore expanding upon his abstract experiences and leaning into more romantic tendencies leading toBlade Runner 2049 where ,0.9956471624759041,0

Renowned auteur Denis Villeneuve proves to be one of the new gods of science fiction yet again with Dune Part One which may very well be his greatest and certainly most ambitious achievement to date doing considerable justice to Frank Herberts seminal source material by way of outstanding performances breathtaking visuals magnificent production design heartracing setpieces wonderfully adapted characters and some of the best and most audacious worldbuilding in a blockbuster in years,0.9950405827396303,0
So Villeneuve seems to never miss because this Dune kinda rocks It s so undeniably epic in scale and that sound design reached deep into my soul man One thing it handles a lot better than Lynch s take is all the information it s gotta deliver they present this really dense world in a more digestible way that pulled me in from the start This story really seems to demand a lot of care and artistry and damn they really brought it Sorry to gush but no notes here that was excellent Jason Momoa stole the show for me and so much orange 2021 Ranked httpsboxditb8ksU,0.9834282401499888,0

Hands down the best thing going for Dune is the stunning visuals from beginning to end Director Denis Villeneuve compiled a beautiful collection of scenes that are truly a sight to see One thing you ll notice is how the cinematography seamlessly compliments so many elements in the film Dune is so masterfully shot that you could watch this movie on mute and still be entertained Despite the dense scielements in the story I appreciated the focused approach on only one ,1.001565778209417,0
Im completely ignorant of the source material minus that its influenced quite a few other properties and its deemed unfilmable hence why I put off seeing it so long But Villeneuve does a fantastic job raising the film to what feels like the wonder of something special almost giving me a pang of jealousy for those who have lived in this world for years with their imaginationIt started to lose me a little at the very end as he hits the big better than the small but overall Im impressed and glad I finally saw it,,1

Wow I didn t think anything could make the 1984 version of Dune look worse than it already did but then Denis Villeneuve said hold my beer It really is hard to believe that both of those movies were adapted from the same source material David Lynch and Denis Villeneuve are both highly respected filmmakers to so you would have to think that both not just Villeneuve could make a successful adaptation Villeneuve has really come on strong in the past ,,1

A boring badly told snoozefest Lifeless acting and a total waste of the use of Charlotte Rampling and Rebecca Ferguson A typical modern day scifiaction film that had dialogue filled with meaningless mumbo jumbo coupled with drab sceneryI m always left wondering why a vision of the future means a colorless world Just gray slabs of concrete and mounds of beige sand The film gives us absolutely nothing Not a story not interesting characters not anything or anyone to care about Even the overused Hans Zimmer created an awful score A waste of 25 hours but that s exactly what I expected,1.0024314727147032,0

A brutalist political space opera whose scale on the big screen at times is truly something to behold As with Villeneuve sBlade Runner 2049amidst the spectacle there is still something here that just feels empty and lifeless although with the former it connects with the themes presented in a more significant way For some this will be a triumphant viewing experience especially those with ties to the novel and the nostalgia for others this will be awe inducing to a degree but ultimately will feel meaningless and overlong,0.9937690359539353,0

Dune is such a well made film Denis Villeneuve is a very imaginative and competent director but this film felt kind of rushed it was like he was afraid he wouldn t get the green light to make sequels so he tried to fit as much as he could into one film Maybe he wanted to make a trilogy or maybe even 5 movies but the budget is so big that he felt he had to make two films in order ,1.000873996696641,0
I ve never really been hyped for this Dune to begin with it just looked uninteresting which I found odd since this seemed to be my type of movie I wasn t even a fan of the book after reading it Now this movie is so grand and ambitious yet it feels so lifeless It s easy to lose track they just add new elements every minute and it s just constant tiresome exposition after tiresome exposition I never doing myself truly invested in ,0.9967676457665149,0
A pretty great example of a movie which is high quality work and yet it did very little for me Its easy to be impressed by Villeneuves and his crews craft cause its the best Hollywood has to offer but where Dune falls short for me is in its tone and because of the way its split into two partsIll go first with the tone the whole thing is too dour almost to the point of grimdark Obviously things ,,1

Finally had a chance to watch this on the big screen and it definitely impressed more this time I still find it more visually impressive than narratively the film is straitjacketed to the original story in a way that allows for few surprises of the Lynchian variety it s utterly lacking in sex appeal Villeneuve suffers from Nolan syndrome in that regard and all the dreamvision sequences fall pretty flat and there are a LOT of them But the casting is strong and it captures the essence of the story I do wish Thufir Hawat didn t get such short shrift thoughAlamo Season Pass,0.9856199559121972,0

 This is only the beginning Eighth seventh in IMAX viewing and it still manages to capture my entire imagination and attention for the entire runtime and more This time I found myself enamored by the framing of hands and how they are the creators and destroyers of our souls desiresPicked up even more elements of the past that Villeneuve incorporates and makes his own Lucas Kubrick Cameron and more are plainly visible but also reappropriated you fit this vision ,0.9691563111348636,0

Dune is a film by Dennis Villeneuve that clearly was intended to be the first movie from a saga the plot is based on a book and it is a blockbuster with many renowned actors but that is actually good because I had a good experience watching itAlthough Dune was released in the higher echelon of cinema regarding budget and marketing it had an interesting impact on me blockbusters and hero movies do not necessarily need to be bland ,0.9872374024488414,0

Denis Villeneuve s Dune has been one of the most anticipated films for the longest time now mostly due to Villeneuve s ability to take a familiar SciFi story Blade Runner 2049 or SciFi and other films in general Arrival Sicario Enemy Incendies and Prisoners and do an incredible job with it Dune is no exception but before we get to the directing let s talk about what else makes this film incredible First off the character development is largely different than you ,0.9982777128588405,0

Short Review Dune is everything I wanted it to be and more artistic nuanced thematically rich well shot well acted and big Full of nuance and subtext DUNE doesnt spoon feed you plot or exposition it drops out into this vast world and carefully lets you into it little by little It soars high above every mainstream Hollywood movie that has come out this year and will come out in the next few months Its a masterpieceLong ,0.9827349824707552,0

Dune doesnt care about you if you havent read the book This was my chief takeaway from a film that is easy to understand plotwise but utterly indecipherable with its characters who inhabit vague archetypes while never really giving you a chance to care about them Out of its huge ensemble there is only a single character that actually feels vaguely human that you want to root for and that character Duncan Idaho is sorely underused by the filmPerhaps ,1.0109491223425064,0

I havent read any of the dune books yet but I can imagine it being pretty hard to adapt this complex story into a series of films It seems like this film is definitely confident in its approach with its serious tone and the presentation of the story fits very well for something that goes above and beyond the average blockbuster while also adapting the first part of this story fairly well from what Ive heard at least If were ,0.9979026631434283,0
After much excitement and fanfare in hearing that Denis Villeneuve was brought on to direct this film After much praise was awarded for bringing on this all star cast After much hyperbole was delivered for claiming this to be the next Star Wars or Lord of the Rings After much delay and patience due to the COVID19 pandemic We finally have the long awaited second feature film adaptation attempt of Frank Herbert s genre defining sciencefiction epic And it s nothing short ,1.0048951846928578,0

If there s one takeaway from Dune it s the scope and the scale of the film A film so large that it merely sets up what comes after an aperitif to the meat of the story There is only one way to watch Dune and it s in theatres on an IMAX screen and even then the screen may prove limiting to the wide expanse of Arrakis and the outsized desires of Villeneuve s latest endeavour Even as a film that s pure ,,1

Why is this movie over 2 hours when it should just be the pilot of a Disney plus showThe amount of times we cut away to the exact same shot of Zendaya is offensive and everyone involved of this film should be fined that amount of time off of their livesNothing happened I cared for no one And the only emotion it made me feel was upset,0.9677258281814902,0

Duneis obviously limited by its format as an introductory and incomplete story which prevents it from reaching the heights ofArrivalandBlade Runner 2049who both packed strong narrative punches but its pretty much the best Dune Part One we could hope forWith the help of an entrancing score and imposing visuals youre quickly immersed in this complex world and the 155 minutes go by very quickly leaving you wanting so much more The table is set for part two and if it maintains the same quality as this one we could be looking at Villeneuves true masterpiece,1.0004205805362312,0
Well it took about 60 goddamn years but we finally got the visually stunning blockbuster epic of Dune that we always needed For me this fully embodies the world of Frank Herberts novel and looks like what I see when reading the text Villeneuve gets it artistically and knows exactly what images to fixate on darkened palace hallways burning palms lilywhite imperial armies dreams of the Fremen and endless expanse of desert sands Structured in a seminonlinear format the prophecies ,,1

somehow captures the cerebral density of the Herberts work scratching the surface of that worlds dense and intricate political spiritual and humanist webwork without relying on the paltry crutch of dialogueinstead Villeneuve ensures that although the core of Herberts writing is still there his own signature storytelling takes the forefront if you didnt vibe with his previous work you might not vibe with this and if youre not open to accept the idiosyncrasies of HerbertsDune then you might ,,1

There is nothing more emasculating than a man dangling from a helicopter kicking his little feetActual thoughtsI wanted to like this so desperately but it was so deeply cringey and not in a cute formulaic rom com wayGlen Powell is BODYING THIS GENRE and he is foine as FUCK I m sorry but Sydney Sweeney does not have a funny bone in her body She seemed like she was in an entirely different movie and did NOT get ,,1

Powell and Sweeney s strong chemistry less buoys the movie than highlights the script s weak contrivances even accepting fluffy rom com logic Their supposed antagonism is never convincing and their romantic rivals are purely functional until discarded The best scene is the most straightforward the least burdened by fauxnaughtiness and dull thorns when the pair fall into Sydney harbour and trade vulnerabilities Uncomplicated and wellperformed fantasy with tourist board money The special cocktails that Hoyts serves at premieres are uniformly disgusting blue things but they re free so I gobble them down like free 1 tickets to premieres Shout out to the Anyone But You premiere DJ,,1

The success of a romcom hinges significantly on the compelling chemistry between its main protagonists as the genres often clich√©d narratives are sustained by the emotional resonance between characters Will Glucks approach in casting the current sensations Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney was strategically sound however the execution fell short as the pair exhibited negligible onscreen chemistry The emotional dynamics appeared more scripted than genuine rendering performances that felt robotic and devoid of the expected mushiness inherent in the genre This lack of chemistry represents a missed opportunity to elevate the films appeal within the romcom genre eventually,0.967188202330427,0

Very fun throwbackMuch Ado proves to be great text to build off of because it fits so well with 90s2000s romcom energy of characters embracing their contrived situation and hoping they can outthink their inevitable romanceAnd as a big plus since the movie isn t being super strict to Shakespeare it doesn t have to have the tonebreaking Don JohnIt s sweet funny and does really well at the romantic moments With this movie I like the central misunderstandings come from internal insecurities and selfdestruction not cosmic happenstances,0.9768113569229058,0
