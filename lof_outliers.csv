POOR THINGS is the most technically dazzling film Yorgos Lanthimos has constructed A sexually liberating imaginative tale of reawakening discovery featuring the best performance of Emma Stone s career Mark Ruffalo has never been funnier The production and costume design is exemplary while Tony McNamara s screenplay contains so much foulmouthed and ingenious wordplay I want to watch it again just to catch all the lines I missed from laughing A sensational triumph all around,1.1450921990530136,0

You can stuff it in unending lace and ruffles but an overly simplistic worldview is an overly simplistic worldview This feels like an acting exercise gone wrong and while I love the production design it still doesn t manage to distract from the fact that the film simply doesn t know what to do with Bella once she s no longer a child Enthusiasm isn t empowerment and the movie doesn t even make a stab at answering the so what that comes after Bella takes control,,1

Liberation from societyPoor Thingsworks so wonderfully as a story of a woman escaping the clutches of patriarchy to reclaim herself Though a second watch really affirmed for me that the film offers little else when it comes to wider politics The fight between choosing cynicism or kindness is still basic and a sidestep to avoid being specific about beliefs and values YetPoor Thingsstill works because of its immersive design and strange humour Its a unique experience ,1.0086145081977633,0
Shelley s Frankenstein combined with Voltaire s Candide as a vile pseudo feminist pastiche of asinine dark humor and hysterical pictorialism Quite unbearable to watch given its grotesque use of very wide and very long lenses and full of imbecilic ideas both formal and thematic Lanthimos huckery whimsical fable of counterfeit idiosyncrasy would probably be more offensive if it wasn t so pathetic,1.1022498833302168,0

It rules that the director of DOGTOOTH has levelled up to being an artist whose newest work can play to a packed theatre of blue hairs that are totally into his vibe laughing it up as Mark Ruffalo makes funny faces in between Emma Stone nuding it up And I dont think Yorgos has compromised his vision either Hes simply been able to find ways to mould style into something palatable to the masses which is somehow an elaborately overdesigned film shot mostly in wideangle lenses that feature a Frankenstein monster having a lot of sex Plus tons of zoomsJess Franco would be proud,1.1799822625299188,0

This is a tremendous piece of art and definitely my favorite movie of 2023 I don t tend to get deep on this app that s what ig is for but there is some sort of rawness and to some extent tenderness of the idea of rediscovering the world once again for all its beauty and all its danger After watching this I find myself thinking about how we once were so naive so innocent so trusting of the things around us ,1.0662809276726704,0

Despite the gratuitous gore and sex there was no mention of periods and only twice were the physical risks associated with prostitution even brought up Given how Bella s sexual assault is presented as part of her liberation a key theme seems to be that if you take pleasure from sexual exploitation it s empowering rather than invasive Bella s intellectual growth is aided by a woman but she is cast aside in favor of her male companion who teaches Bella about poverty ,1.0391607595398005,0

A bag full of tricks that occasionally ring hollow and cheap Oversexed for the sake of it which makes the first half of the movie feel unnecessary and repetitive Also the whole Alexandria portion felt racist insensitive at best I feel like there s no depth It s hinted at and occasionally approached but never really dove into I still think about Dogtooth sometimes and I could revisit the favourite many times but I don t have any of that enthusiasm from this ,,1
 I need to offer something to the world and yet I have nothing Poor Things by Yorgos Lanthimos could almost be described as an odyssey one where a woman who before saw no way forward in her life gets an unexpected chance to have another tryIt is a fascinating experience to get to rediscover our world through Bella Baxter s eyes watching her go from naive and helpless prisoner to an independent free spirit who knows what she wants and ,1.5726599957102212,0

Poor Things is a delicious little movie set in a big curious world Yorgos Lanthimos latest film is a continuation of his meditation on developmental manipulation and telling stories about people doing fucked up stuff to each other but this time its wrapped in a completely new veneer Completely visually distinct from his previous works Poor Things builds a world that reflects its protagonists perspective first existing exclusively within the walls of her creators home then broadening to a fisheye ,1.0340676964869782,0

Representing 2023 amongFilms Nominated for Best PictureAmazingly bizarre And it is bizarrely amazing that this very adult fantasy has been nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award Yet it is easily the best I have seen from director Yorgos Lanthimos and from actress Emma Stone and a wonderfully unique character is played by Willem DafoeI must note that the theater was about half full for the matinee I attended and only one person walked out possibly offended by the graphic sexual content From a feminist POV this is Barbie on steroids laced with LSD See it by all means,1.1639951143440403,0

Poor Thingsis Yorgos Lanthimos at his best His signature absurdity is pushed so far in this movies visuals and dialogue and characters that it creates such a beautiful movie The futuristic visuals were reminiscent of how people in the 181900s predicted the 2000s to look all while this movie takes place in the late 1800s with the societal norms and what not This was such a creative interpretation of the book that I never would have imagined while ,1.019547278777146,0

It s hard not to admire the sheer inventiveness and creativity going on here Lanthimos crafts a world that is so strange to look at but still wholly feasible Emma Stone is really incredible in the central role giving a transformative performance that is at times moving and at other times hilarious Ruffalo really steals the show every line delivery and facial expression is funnier than the last Sadly I wasn t that invested in the actual narrative and I felt like ,1.030776956824552,0

Yorgos Lanthimos has always been the master of tone and this is no exception Its incredibly bizarre yet never in a way that pulls you out of the experience The worldbuilding is exceptional and those oneliners hit hard Perhaps his most moving film yet and definitely Mark Ruffalos best performance In interviews Ruffalo said that he was swinging for the fences and flirting with disaster with his performance and he couldnt be more right In lesser hands this performance indeed ,1.027737889428637,0

What I ve always liked about Yorgos Lanthimos as a director is how his films are so incredibly blunt that they eventually cross the event horizon completely becoming something that requires serious time to fully considerThe base is obvious Frankenstein s monster My immediate comparison was the scene from Bride where the monster befriends the blind man in the woods Smoke Good And Stone must ve been taking inspiration for the first act of her incredible performanceSo the monster is a beautiful ,1.253777202936953,0

Fucking my way to self actualization in the puffiest sleeves you have ever seen in your life is how I m going to try and approach 2024As much as I find the costume and production design fuckingravishing I think Lánthimos direction is too dry for what the material could be if it were infused with the pure feminine sensibility of high melodrama Frankly underwhelming considering how Me the themes are but at least I can finally say I really like Emma Stone in something,1.5052619421725066,0

Yorgos Lanthimos the madman has not written the screenplays for his last two movies yet brought out his two most distinctive visions with these films The Frankenstein reading of Gray s book is one of the most accurate and entertaining screen versions of Shelley s story namely in the philosophical education of the creation Lanthimos inventive look for everything here is as whimsical and free as its lead character willing to reach for big laughs with absurdity and profanity that feels potent and meaningfulPoor Thingsis a great allegory only a hair too long and packed with joy for those seeking its exact mood,1.0505785100605958,0

yorgos lanthimos is definitely in his Mainstream Weird phase I havent seen any of his earlier works besides The Favorite and I think thats probably why something as risque and surreal as this can get 11 oscar nominations without it seemingly particularly unusual to anybody that the academy would take that much interest in it its actually a very straightforward film narratively so much so that a lot of the surreal style comes off more as window dressing to me ,0.9919060580194532,0
I refuse to watch this movie but I have to talk about it This film is Hollywood pedophile propaganda trying to normalize having sex with children The mind of a child in the body having sex with adult men This will be the only movie on here I rate with stars both to bring down its score and to remain on my page so people can see what this movie truly is This is not feminist its pedophilic Jeffery Epstein ,1.047946404391317,0

I genuinely think this is the greatest film I ve ever seen beforeWeird hilarious and beautiful what Yorgos does with this film is truly remarkable and unlike anything I ve ever seen The costume and production design are both incredibly done I really loved this gorgeously bizarre world that we re thrown into Robbie Ryan s work behind the camera is such a triumph on the senses the way he shoots this film is so unique and intriguing that it becomes so effortless ,,1
Woah where do I start first I wanna say that I actually expected to enjoy it a bit more I still liked it a lot of course I see it as a coming of age movie exploration of life and its good and bad flavors Classic Lanthimos so bold so creative he even menages to exceed himself pulling off that crazy story unique camera work editing set designs and costumes The performances are astonishing Emma is just brilliant,1.2812712005892233,0

Emma Stone is brilliant in this movie Mark Ruffalo is hilarious and Willem Defoe plays such a tragic character but in a humorous way The sets were beautiful the costumes were stunning The story was so interesting A story of a woman feeding her curiosity and not following the rules that are expected of woman at the time whatever time it is supposed to beI am enjoying Yorgos Lanthimos films He is becoming a must see director for me A Very eclectic story teller,1.0734695157976297,0

Poor Things is visually spectacular Its a painting I want to hang on my wall forever The production design and costumes are excellent The cast is excellent This is my favorite performance from Emma Stone Its one of those films you just know people will be referencing for years to comeIts an interesting compelling story that just didnt move me deeply Thats not a slight against the film I dont think its flawed or anything I just didnt feel ,,1
it starts off so strong meanders slightly and somewhat hams up its message by the midway point but absolutely sticks the incredible landing Super funny poignant and with such powerhouse performances I d be disappointed if it didn t receive serious Oscar recognition especially as it seems this is gaining more traction among casual audiences than Lanthimos usually getsProbably one of the final entries in my2023 rankedlist as I finish up the year96th Best Picture Nominees Ranked,1.1064308514519037,0

In which Yorgos deposits his blank check and descends into meandering selfparody flailing about from repeated wisecrack to repetitive punchline It aims for the madcap whimsy of the best Burtons with a sexual edge but by the time its thoroughly overworked and poorly paced narrative is through you ll find yourself admiring Emma Stone s admittedly stellar performance and little else A massive disappointment from the heights ofThe LobsterandThe Favourite,,1
I find myself in a tricky spot with Poor Things On one hand its a transfixing fantasia that showcases the astonishing collaboration of Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos There is no doubt that this duo is going to give us many masterpieces for years to come enabling and deepening each others most unique creative instincts On the other I find that Lanthimos hyper absurdist take on the Frankenstein story has its limits when it tries to delve into territory deeper ,,1

Yorgos has got it done in style Ive always found his films to be a little off and not in an enjoyable way but this goes literally balls deep in the weirdness and allows Yorgos to cook up a film I cant really compare to anything else Ive seen The world characters and narrative are all wacky and engaging the costume design is immense and the repeated use of the fisheye lens was very nice Not quite my 1 of ,1.0061067783589768,0

The biggest problem though is Hans Zimmer whose score is incredibly loud and unremittingly the dominant sound for more of the movie s 155 minutes than not Zimmer s approach to musical cultural appropriation has been blithe since at least 1994 sThe Lion King while his subsequent rise to Coachella fame has accelerated improbably Both worlds collide inDune s score a nightmare barrage of fieldfilling drums punctuated by the odd muezzinish call to prayer given how fraught the material already is brownskinned desert ,1.0597313900665437,0

DUNE was everything I wanted it to be and more From the reams of backroom intrigue unscrupulous politicking and denselywrought panglobal mysticism Denis Villeneuve has made this film which does justice to a hallowed text while retaining the slick formal shape of a pop movie And that in itself is no small achievement Where Villeneuve s previous work Blade Runner 2049 too often embraced soporific longueurs as a shortcut to profundity here the sheer meatiness of this ripping yarn is always ,1.289930509483418,0

Creating a faithful adaptation ofDunebrings many limitations If you want to tell the entire story it must be split across multiple movies and deal with a large cast of complicated characters To capture the epic scale and alien worlds requires a blockbuster budget and hence commercial interests bringing further limitations Now a very dense book has to be made accessible with more action and more explanation Denis VilleneuvesDuneis not a perfect film but I cannot imagine ,1.5173431457834758,0

I dont really know anything about Dune lore so I found the actual story pretty boring Sort of hard to make a movie about premonitions that arent fulfilled before you stand up to go That said I was fascinated by the imperial culture and all the traditions and such It makes sense to me that over a long period of time humanity would return to rank and ritual This seems more plausible than the Star Trek future of nerds going on field trips Well I guess this movie is about a nerd going on a field trip too but you get my meaning,1.0330466385600046,0
The straightedge take on that greatest of psychedelic scifi epics replacing a world of interior monologue freakish mutation and Blakean visions with vast interiors so colossal they absorb light where imperial might is conveyed via overwhelming arrays of soldiers and combat vehicles and where clandestine political games are played in echoing chambers It should be unbearable but much as Villeneuves humorlessness suitedBlade Runners realm of literally dehumanized labor so too does it work for a story that is fundamentally ,1.0254802130945908,0

Dunefeels less like a movie and more like a window into a distant alternate reality Its focus isn t on progressing a story there s no rush to get to the next set piece to make characters fulfill their purposes to arrive at what it s all been leading up to InsteadDuneasks us to take a leap of faith as it patiently uncovers the remote corners of centuries old civilizationsDubbedPart One it undertakes two tasks each massive in ,,1

Anticipation is not merely a word to describe my longing for this film Denis Villeneuve is one of my favourite filmmakers and he does know how to make the viewers awestruck with immersive visual driven cinematic experience Its not perfect or grounded because we havent yet apprehended towards the whole saga Dune once considered unfilmable and two auteurs Jodorowsky and Lynch even failed in the attempts The worldbuilding is just insanely meticulous and sophisticated As Im not familiar with books ,1.2069820233028912,0

O cinema de Villeneuve é emocionalmente árido Falo com tranquilidade e no geral mesmo assim gosto bastante Talvez porque a conexão emocional maior seja com a beleza das imagens No caso de Duna elas abundam As locações e os cenários apequenam os humanos que transitam por eles E felizmente a trama em sua versão é inteligível sorte que Lynch não teve Além disso é um enorme alívio ver um filme dessa escala e me deparar com tantodiálogoemaquinação política ,1.070958845617145,0

Renowned auteur Denis Villeneuve proves to be one of the new gods of science fiction yet again with Dune Part One which may very well be his greatest and certainly most ambitious achievement to date doing considerable justice to Frank Herberts seminal source material by way of outstanding performances breathtaking visuals magnificent production design heartracing setpieces wonderfully adapted characters and some of the best and most audacious worldbuilding in a blockbuster in years,1.2486053588207182,0
So Villeneuve seems to never miss because this Dune kinda rocks It s so undeniably epic in scale and that sound design reached deep into my soul man One thing it handles a lot better than Lynch s take is all the information it s gotta deliver they present this really dense world in a more digestible way that pulled me in from the start This story really seems to demand a lot of care and artistry and damn they really brought it Sorry to gush but no notes here that was excellent Jason Momoa stole the show for me and so much orange 2021 Ranked httpsboxditb8ksU,1.0540407038026607,0

Absolutely loved the intense experience The score was probably my favorite aspect with the imagery being a close secondI couldn t give it 5 stars because of the obvious flaws One of the biggest being its struggle with being personal However it also seems like the book was so dense that some characters missed out on the ability to have personal story lines in favor of fitting the main plot points in the run time of the movie Maybe should have been told in 3 or 4 parts ,1.008741005387044,0

Absolutely baffled by the huge scale of this Ambitious projects like this always fascinate me and with this director and cast attached you just can t afford to miss it in theaters The visuals alone are sheer magic on a big screenI knew that this is presumably the first in a franchise but still rolled my eyes at the final line Can t believe they ended with that Would be so embarrassing now if Warner didn t greenlight a second part ,0.9942881629746244,0

2021The most genuinely dorky shit ever backed by a major studio and it s incredible An overwhelming barrage of sight and sound where lore and plot almost don t matter It s compelling certainly but the investment hinges more on wowing you with something you ve never experienced before and I think Villeneuve accomplishes that one hundred times over I ve never fully vibed with him as a filmmaker even though his craft is undeniable WithDune he s created a truly immersive experience unlike ,1.038694429731517,0

This film is unquestionably one of the titans of modern day sciencefiction and yet another masterpiece by Denis Villeneuve who is one of the directors I find it easiest to connect with After following up Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 with this it cannot be denied that Villeneuve truly is a spearhead as it pertains to sciencefiction filmmakingThe way Paul Atreides is constantly overlooked and doubted in his mission to save the world makes him a character everyone wants ,1.1233206373443863,0

Dune is such a well made film Denis Villeneuve is a very imaginative and competent director but this film felt kind of rushed it was like he was afraid he wouldn t get the green light to make sequels so he tried to fit as much as he could into one film Maybe he wanted to make a trilogy or maybe even 5 movies but the budget is so big that he felt he had to make two films in order ,1.0946269264526047,0

Finally had a chance to watch this on the big screen and it definitely impressed more this time I still find it more visually impressive than narratively the film is straitjacketed to the original story in a way that allows for few surprises of the Lynchian variety it s utterly lacking in sex appeal Villeneuve suffers from Nolan syndrome in that regard and all the dreamvision sequences fall pretty flat and there are a LOT of them But the casting is strong and it captures the essence of the story I do wish Thufir Hawat didn t get such short shrift thoughAlamo Season Pass,1.156000539161198,0

Its well established that filmmakers can make very big things look very cool What seems to be the real challenge and one that Villeneuve either doesnt get or doesnt care for is directing the humans that give the medium the emotional weight around those very big things whether it be huge desert worms or brutal architechture or just lots and lots of sand in a way that doesnt drown or negate the human factor in favour of spectacle ,1.3378978206337575,0

New adoration for this film even on top of my original love I had for it since the beginning The perfect adaptation of the first half of the book Think what also made me appreciate this one a lot more too is Denis own fandom for the source material and incorporating certain elements to enhance the narrative for nonreaders and make this one and hopefullyPart IIaccessible for any fan of grand scale movies and scifi Respect the vision Denis Can t wait to cop that new popcorn bucket,1.0201480422555773,0

 This is only the beginning Eighth seventh in IMAX viewing and it still manages to capture my entire imagination and attention for the entire runtime and more This time I found myself enamored by the framing of hands and how they are the creators and destroyers of our souls desiresPicked up even more elements of the past that Villeneuve incorporates and makes his own Lucas Kubrick Cameron and more are plainly visible but also reappropriated you fit this vision ,1.077886396081108,0

Dune is a film by Dennis Villeneuve that clearly was intended to be the first movie from a saga the plot is based on a book and it is a blockbuster with many renowned actors but that is actually good because I had a good experience watching itAlthough Dune was released in the higher echelon of cinema regarding budget and marketing it had an interesting impact on me blockbusters and hero movies do not necessarily need to be bland ,1.0003987558418979,0

Timothee Chalamet is a very special boyI actually dont mind him that much and he does a decent job here Hes a bit outclassed by Rebecca Ferguson though not to mention Oscar IsaacBut whatever Villeneuve is such a strong directorial force that his actors almost regardless of their performances are buoyed by the incredible milieus he creates His worlds are so complete and compelling that the actors seem to be living inside of them not performing This is ,1.0132369301634325,0

Denis Villeneuve s Dune has been one of the most anticipated films for the longest time now mostly due to Villeneuve s ability to take a familiar SciFi story Blade Runner 2049 or SciFi and other films in general Arrival Sicario Enemy Incendies and Prisoners and do an incredible job with it Dune is no exception but before we get to the directing let s talk about what else makes this film incredible First off the character development is largely different than you ,1.0125789716337956,0

Short Review Dune is everything I wanted it to be and more artistic nuanced thematically rich well shot well acted and big Full of nuance and subtext DUNE doesnt spoon feed you plot or exposition it drops out into this vast world and carefully lets you into it little by little It soars high above every mainstream Hollywood movie that has come out this year and will come out in the next few months Its a masterpieceLong ,,1
i know this is probably part of some lore from the book that i don t know about but i think it s so funny that this is set in the year 10200 or whatever and some of the characters names are like Paul and Jessica,1.00519513667285,0
So glad I got to see this in IMAX as it s probably the best theater experience I ve ever had It doesn t have as much of an emotional impact as some of Denis other films likeArrivalbut the technical aspects elevate this film so muchDunetruly is a marvel The worldbuilding and scope of this film are so grand but handled very well by Denis Villenueve who has to be the best director working today at creating big budget scifi ,1.0423744623858737,0

As a narratively honest adaptaion Villeneuve pretty much by design is forced to make the compromise of streamlining the novels immense complexity and metaphysical tone as well as covering only half of the story But as a cinematic experience it is the type of shiverinducing jawdropping elemental trip that turns someone into a fullblown cinephile Astonishing visual effects striking powerful images even with the heavily monochrome colour palette terrific performances from the cast every minute of it makes you feel ,1.072974963931758,0

Your enjoyment of this film definitely hinges on how much you like ultra cheesy rom coms and the song Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield and thankfully I am a fan of bothThis doesn t do anything too special with the genre but it doesn t need to Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell simply share electric chemistry and they are a joy to watch The supporting cast including Alexandra Shipp of Jexi fame add a lot of fun to the film Just a really good time at the movies,1.0444284529090582,0

The reason why the conflicts feel so anecdotic and trifling in this film is mainly because there is no feeling to be found anywhere here so every dramatic arc work as a vague idea of illusory quarrels that barely make sense Everything is arbitrary the insufferable characters work as puppets deprived of any recognizable interiority just fake half baked archetypes of rich beautiful people in a bad perfume commercial filled with silly jokes which is definitely ironic for a film ,1.0975495661781098,0

Is it good Not really the internal logic is embarrassingly flawed it doesnt do nearly enough with its R rating and the constant references to Shakespeare only highlight how bad the dialogue can be but literally none of that matters when Glenn Powell and Sydney Sweeney are becoming genuine movie stars before your very eyes They sparkle and sizzle so brightly that you cant look at anything else and thats enough to make this a frisky fun holiday treat,1.070786430166475,0

Taking the films Shakespearean slant Anyone But You has a wickedly fun premise as Powell and Sweeney who once had a thing but cannot bear the sight of one another now begrudgingly lock eyes and fake flirt to create a ruse that theyre now head over heels in love Its a shame that the film takes nearly 40 minutes to make this happen though The chemistry between the central leads has its moments but with an uninspired script they cant ,1.123057743428864,0

It brings me no pleasure to report that this just isn t very good primarily because it s wildly inconsistent Sydney Sweeney is pretty great as a classic romcom klutz in the opening scene and her character is completely different for the rest of the movie she suddenly has much less personality The commitment to the Shakespeare source material is all over the place and it d be better if it went harder in either direction And some of the performers playing the stock supporting characters are straightup bad which is rare for a movie of this size I do enjoy the landmark finale at least,1.0996802277532567,0

Powell and Sweeney s strong chemistry less buoys the movie than highlights the script s weak contrivances even accepting fluffy rom com logic Their supposed antagonism is never convincing and their romantic rivals are purely functional until discarded The best scene is the most straightforward the least burdened by fauxnaughtiness and dull thorns when the pair fall into Sydney harbour and trade vulnerabilities Uncomplicated and wellperformed fantasy with tourist board money The special cocktails that Hoyts serves at premieres are uniformly disgusting blue things but they re free so I gobble them down like free 1 tickets to premieres Shout out to the Anyone But You premiere DJ,1.0115452839996149,0

The success of a romcom hinges significantly on the compelling chemistry between its main protagonists as the genres often clichéd narratives are sustained by the emotional resonance between characters Will Glucks approach in casting the current sensations Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney was strategically sound however the execution fell short as the pair exhibited negligible onscreen chemistry The emotional dynamics appeared more scripted than genuine rendering performances that felt robotic and devoid of the expected mushiness inherent in the genre This lack of chemistry represents a missed opportunity to elevate the films appeal within the romcom genre eventually,1.0853306249004238,0

Oh lord when Bryan Brown showed up I knew we were in trouble Although this film isn t great it is at least kind of interesting to see a more subtle way in which mainstream Hollywood productions synthesise queer representation thought out movies but in such a way that it s still pushed to the side and made as straight and sanitised as possible to appeal to the massesMy god this was the quietest cinema I ve ever been in No ,1.0670979366810258,0

silly sexy fun and i love to see this kind of romcom back especially it being a modern day adaptation of a classic novelplay and i loved the way they incorporated a lot of the quotes from the original source material throughout too bad theyre not beating the no chemistry allegations other than that kiss WHEWW and with such a fanfiction script and tropes that i would love for a romcom but can only work and be pulled off if the leads have the chemistry for it which these two sadly do not,1.0231816717834838,0
